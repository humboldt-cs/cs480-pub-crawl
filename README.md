Written in Java using Android Studio.

To enhance the party-adventurers next night out with this charming and easy to use mobile experience. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social App
- **Mobile:** The app is geared to be used "on the fly" as a group of friends organize and travel to different destinations across a city's night-life ecosystem. It uses real-time technology, such as maps, location info and recommendations, and user/friends status.
- **Story:** Allows very feasible ways to coordinate night-out, 
- **Market:**
- **Habit:** Its after 5, works done, its the weekend, etc, and the user is determined they are now in "party-mode" until they're tucked into bed. They're looking for fun things to do and fun friends to do it with. Our app is geared as a companion to enhance that experience from beginning to end. The user is to associate this mode and experience with our app. 
- **Scope:**

I can affirm that if this app were completed and available on the Play Store, I and fellow friends would be using this app on a weekly basis minimum.
